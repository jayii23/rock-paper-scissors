    <h1>GUI Coming Soon(ish)!</h1>
    <p>For now... enter either rock, paper, or scissors into the prompt. When the prompts no longer
        show up the game is over and you can view your results by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting 'inspect'
        . This will open a panel on the right side of your browser (preferrably google chrome). At the very top of this new panel 
        select 'Console'. Now you should be able to view the results of each round and the total results! 
    </p>
    <p>If you would like to play another round, simply refresh the page!</p>

    <div>
        <p id="game-results">
            //results of game
        </p>

        <p id="round-results">
            //results of round
        </p>
